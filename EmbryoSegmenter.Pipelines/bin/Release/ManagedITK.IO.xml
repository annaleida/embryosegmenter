Update() checks modified times against last execution times, and

ss that the whole pipeline may execute in order to bring this filter
up-to-date. This method updates the currently prescribed requested region.
If no requested region has been set on the output, then the requested
region will be set to the largest possible region. Once the requested
region is set, Update() will make sure the specified requested region 
is up-to-date. To have a filter always to produce its largest possible

Update() checks modified times against last execution times, and

If no requested region has been set on the output, then the requested
region will be set to the largest possible region. Once the requested
region is set, Update() will make sure the specified requested region 
is up-to-date. To have a filter always to produce its largest possible

Update() checks modified times against last execution times, and

Adds a native observer watching for any event.

By default, observers are created for all events. Calling this
method adds a single native observer for any event. This
observer invokes the managed events. Therefore, calling this
method more than once, or calling it without first calling
RemoveAllObservers(), may cause the managed events to be
invoked more than once.

By default, observers are created for all events. Calling this

            <remarks>
Update() checks modified times against last execution times, and
re-executes objects if necessary. A side effect of this method
ss that the whole pipeline may execute in order to bring this filter
up-to-date. This method updates the currently prescribed requested region.
If no requested region has been set on the output, then the requested
region will be set to the largest possible region. Once the requested
region is set, Update() will make sure the specified requested region 
is up-to-date. To have a filter always to produce its largest possible
region, users should call UpdateLargestPossibleRegion() instead.

By default, observers are created for all events. Calling this
method removes all native observers, and therefore prevents
the firing of managed events. Call AddAnyEventObserver() to

 Description:
    This file provides generic ascii file parsing capabilities.
    It assumes that the files consist of a set of fields
    Each field is list of variable = value pairs

 Features:
    There can be dependencies between fields, required fields, 
       and optional fields.
    Undefined fields are skipped.
    Values must conform to expected types.   There can be default 
       values for fields.

method removes all native observers, and therefore prevents
the firing of managed events. Call AddAnyEventObserver() to
reset the default observers which enable the managed events.

the firing of managed events. Call AddAnyEventObserver() to
reset the default observers which enable the managed events.

By default, observers are created for all events. Calling this

RemoveAllObservers(), may cause the managed events to be

re-executes objects if necessary. A side effect of this method
ss that the whole pipeline may execute in order to bring this filter
up-to-date. This method updates the currently prescribed requested region.
If no requested region has been set on the output, then the requested
region will be set to the largest possible region. Once the requested
region is set, Update() will make sure the specified requested region 
is up-to-date. To have a filter always to produce its largest possible
region, users should call UpdateLargestPossibleRegion() instead.

Update() checks modified times against last execution times, and
re-executes objects if necessary. A side effect of this method
ss that the whole pipeline may execute in order to bring this filter
up-to-date. This method updates the currently prescribed requested region.
If no requested region has been set on the output, then the requested
region will be set to the largest possible region. Once the requested
region is set, Update() will make sure the specified requested region 
is up-to-date. To have a filter always to produce its largest possible

Update() checks modified times against last execution times, and

If no requested region has been set on the output, then the requested

Update() checks modified times against last execution times, and
re-executes objects if necessary. A side effect of this method
ss that the whole pipeline may execute in order to bring this filter
up-to-date. This method updates the currently prescribed requested region.
If no requested region has been set on the output, then the requested
region will be set to the largest possible region. Once the requested
region is set, Update() will make sure the specified requested region 
is up-to-date. To have a filter always to produce its largest possible
region, users should call UpdateLargestPossibleRegion() instead.

  * \brief Class that defines how to read Analyze file format.
  * Analyze IMAGE FILE FORMAT - As much information as I can determine from the Medical image
  * formats web site, and the Analyze75.pdf file provided from the Mayo clinic.
  * A special note of thanks to Dennis P. Hanson (dph@mayo.edu) for his generous contributions
  * in getting this information correct.
  *
  * Analyze image file sets consist of at least 2 files:
  * REQUIRED:
  *    - an image file  ([basename].img or [basename].img.gz or [basename].img.Z)
  *          This contains the binary represenation of the raw voxel values.
  *          If the file is uncompressed, it should be of of size (sizeof(storagetype)*NX*NY*NZ(*NT).
  *          The format of the image file is very simple; containing usually
  *          uncompressed voxel data for the images in one of the several
  *          possible voxel formats:
  *             - 1 bit  packed binary (slices begin on byte boundaries)
  *             - 8 bit  (unsigned char) gray scale unless .lkup file present
  *             - 16 bit signed short
  *             - 32 bit signed integers or float
  *             - 24 bit RGB, 8 bits per channel
  *    - a header file  ([basename].hdr)
  *          This a 348 byte file 99.99% of all images that contains a binary represenation of the C-struct
  *          defined in this file.  The analyze 7.5 header structure may, however, be extended beyond this minimal defintion
  *          to encompase site specific information, and would have more than 348 bytes.  Given that the
  *          ability to extend the header has rarely been used, this implementation of the Analyze 7.5
  *          file will only read the first 348 bytes into the structure defined in this file, and all informaiton beyond the
  *          348 bytes will be ignored.
  * OPTIONAL:
  *    - a color lookup file ([basename].lkup)
  *      The .lkup file is a plain ASCII text file that contains 3 integer values between 0 and 255
  *      on each line.  Each line of the lkup file represents one color table entry for the Red,
  *      Green and Blue color components, respectively.  The total dynamic range of the image
  *      is divided by the number of colors in color table to determine mapping of the image through
  *      these colors.
  *       For example, an 8-color 'rainbow colors' lookup table is represented as:
  *       ===========================
  *       255 0 0
  *       255 128 0
  *       255 255 0
  *       128 255 0
  *       0 255 0
  *       0 0 255
  *       128 0 255
  *       255 0 255
  *       ===========================
  *    - an object file ([basename].obj)
  *      A specially formated file with a mapping between object name and image code used to associate
  *      image voxel locations with a label.  This file is run length encoded to save disk storage.

Analyze 7.5 header structure
The header file is a 'C' structure which describes the dimensions
and properties of the voxel data.
NOTE: Values in convenience fields should have no
      effect on how this file is interpreted.
      These fields are not used read by the Analyze Program,
      but are written as a convenience for interpreting the

\struct data_history
Most of these are historical, relevant to use with the Dynamic Spatial
Reconstructor scanner developed at the Mayo BIR in the late 70's and through
the 80's.  However, the 'orient' field is very important and
is used to indicate individual slice orientation and determines whether
the Analyze 'Movie' program will attempt to flip the images before
displaying a movie sequence.  It is perfectly acceptable to put any
values you want into those fields because they do not(should not)
affect image processing.

\class ProgressReporter
 * \brief Implements progress tracking for a filter.
 *
 * This is a utility class for use by filter implementations in
 * GenerateData() and ThreadedGenerateData().
 *
 * The class constructor sets the progress to 0, and the destructor
 * sets it to 1.  In between, there should be one call to
 * CompletedPixel() per pixel.  The reporter will automatically update
 * the filter's progress at an interval resulting in the specified
 * number of updates.  The default number of updates is 100.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * \code
 *   ProgressReporter progress(this, threadId,
 *                             threadRegion.GetNumberOfPixels(), 100);
 *   for( each pixel )
 *     {
 *     ...
 *     progress.CompletedPixel();
 *     }
 * \endcode
 *
 * When used in a non-threaded filter, the threadId argument should be 0.
 *
 * \sa
 * This class is a tool for filter implementers to equip a filter to
 * report on its progress.  For information on how to acquire this
 * progress information, see:
 *  - ProcessObject::ReportProgress()
 *  - Object::AddObserver()

Like Update(), but sets the output requested region to the
largest possible region for the output. This is the method users
should call if they want the entire dataset to be processed. If
a user wants to update the same output region as a previous call
to Update() or a previous call to UpdateLargestPossibleRegion(), 
then they should call the method Update().

Bring this filter up-to-date.
</summary>
            <remarks>
Update() checks modified times against last execution times, and
re-executes objects if necessary. A side effect of this method
ss that the whole pipeline may execute in order to bring this filter
up-to-date. This method updates the currently prescribed requested region.
If no requested region has been set on the output, then the requested
region will be set to the largest possible region. Once the requested
region is set, Update() will make sure the specified requested region 
is up-to-date. To have a filter always to produce its largest possible
region, users should call UpdateLargestPossibleRegion() instead.

            <summary>
Adds a native observer watching for any event.
</summary>
            <remarks>
By default, observers are created for all events. Calling this
method adds a single native observer for any event. This
observer invokes the managed events. Therefore, calling this
method more than once, or calling it without first calling
RemoveAllObservers(), may cause the managed events to be
invoked more than once.

            <remarks>
By default, observers are created for all events. Calling this
method removes all native observers, and therefore prevents
the firing of managed events. Call AddAnyEventObserver() to
reset the default observers which enable the managed events.

 * ITK. itkObject implements a Subject/Observer pattern. When a subject 
 * needs to notify a observer, it does so using a itkCommand.  The Execute

 \brief Basic quad-edge topological method.

 This method describes all possible topological operations on an edge.

 It is its own inverse. It works in two ways:

   1. If this-&gt;GetOrg() != b-&gt;GetOrg(), it slice a face in two.
   2. If this-&gt;GetOrg() == b-&gt;GetOrg(), it unifies two faces.

 \warning This class only handles of the connectivity and is not aware
    of the geometry that lies at the \ref GeometricalQuadEdge level.
    It is strongly discouraged to use this method. Instead you should
    use itk::QuadEdgeMesh::Splice it's geometry aware version.

\class ImageIOBase
 * \brief Abstract superclass defines image IO interface.
 *
 * ImageIOBase is a class that reads and/or writes image data
 * of a particular format (such as PNG or raw binary). The
 * ImageIOBase encapsulates both the reading and writing of data. The
 * ImageIOBase is used by the ImageFileReader class (to read data)
 * and the ImageFileWriter (to write data) into a single file. The
 * ImageSeriesReader and ImageSeriesWriter classes are used to read
 * and write data (in conjunction with ImageIOBase) when the data is
 * represented by a series of files. Normally the user does not directly
 * manipulate this class other than to instantiate it, set the FileName,
 * and assign it to a ImageFileReader/ImageFileWriter or
 * ImageSeriesReader/ImageSeriesWriter.
 *
 * A Pluggable factory pattern is used this allows different kinds of readers
 * to be registered (even at run time) without having to modify the
 * code in this class.

\class LightProcessObject
 * \brief LightProcessObject is the base class for all process objects (source,
          filters, mappers) in the Insight data processing pipeline.
 *
 * LightProcessObject is an abstract object that specifies behavior and
 * interface of visualization network process objects (sources, filters,
 * mappers). Source objects are creators of visualization data; filters
 * input, process, and output visualization data; and mappers transform data
 * into another form (like rendering primitives or write data to a file).
 *
 * A major role of LightProcessObject is to define the inputs and outputs
 * of a filter. More than one input and/or output may exist for a given
 * filter. Some classes (e.g., source objects or mapper objects) will
 * not use inputs (the source) or outputs (mappers). In this case, the
 * inputs or outputs is just ignored.
 *
 * LightProcessObject invokes the following events: 
 * , Command::StartEvent, Command::EndEvent
 * These are convenience events you can use for any purpose
 * (e.g., debugging info, highlighting/notifying user interface, etc.) 
 * See Command and LightObject for information on using AddObserver.
 *
 * Another event Command::ProgressEvent can be observed. Some filters invoke
 * this event periodically during their execution (with the progress,
 * parameter, the fraction of work done). The use is similar to that of
 * StartEvent and EndEvent. Filters may also check their
 * AbortGenerateData flag to determine whether to prematurally end their
 * execution.
 *
 * An important feature of subclasses of LightProcessObject is that it is
 * possible to control the memory-management model (i.e., retain output
 * versus delete output data). If enabled the ReleaseDataFlag enables the
 * deletion of the output data once the downstream process object finishes
 * processing the data (please see text).
 *
 * Subclasses of LightProcessObject may override 4 of the methods of this class
 * to control how a given filter may interact with the pipeline (dataflow).
 * These methods are: GenerateOutputInformation(),
 * EnlargeOutputRequestedRegion(), GenerateInputRequestedRegion(), and
 * GenerateOutputRequestedRegion(). By overriding these methods, a filter
 * can deviate from the base assumptions of the pipeline execution model.

\class FastMutexLock
 * \brief Critical section locking class.
 * 
 * FastMutexLock allows the locking of variables which are accessed 
 * through different threads.  This header file also defines 
 * SimpleFastMutexLock which is not a subclass of Object.
 * The API is identical to that of MutexLock, and the behavior is
 * identical as well, except on Windows 9x/NT platforms. The only difference
 * on these platforms is that MutexLock is more flexible, in that
 * it works across processes as well as across threads, but also costs
 * more, in that it evokes a 600-cycle x86 ring transition. The 
 * FastMutexLock provides a higher-performance equivalent (on 
 * Windows) but won't work across processes. Since it is unclear how,
 * in itk, an object at the itk level can be shared across processes
 * in the first place, one should use FastMutexLock unless one has
 * a very good reason to use MutexLock. If higher-performance equivalents
 * for non-Windows platforms (Irix, SunOS, etc) are discovered, they
 * should replace the implementations in this class

\class Region
 * \brief A region represents some portion or piece of data.
 *
 * Region is an abstract class that represents some portion or
 * piece of a DataObject. A region is used by the pipeline when
 * processing just a portion of the data, either because 1) memory
 * limits dictate that the pipeline cannot fit the entire dataset
 * into memory; 2) the user has requested that only a piece of the
 * dataset is to be processed; or 3) parallel (multi-threaded)
 * processing of the data is required.
 *
 * There are two types of regions in itk: a structured region that
 * specifies a rectangular piece of an image (ImageRegion), and a
 * unstructured region that specifies piece i of N total pieces
 * (MeshRegion). Depending on the filter (its input and output
 * types, and its position in the pipeline), ImageRegion or MeshRegion
 * will be used to describe the region.
 *
 * Region is a light-weight object and not reference counted. This 
 * means that is behaves differently than ITK classes that are
 * reference counted. For example, smart pointer access is not
 * provided, and the (subclasses') constructor, destructor, 
 * copy constructor and operator= are all public.

Friends of DataObject 

Friends of Multithreader.
   * ProcessObject is a friend so that it can call PrintSelf() on its
   * Multithreader. 

\class ProcessObject
 * \brief ProcessObject is the base class for all process objects (source,
 *        filters, mappers) in the Insight data processing pipeline.
 *
 * ProcessObject is an abstract object that specifies behavior and
 * interface of network process objects (sources, filters,
 * mappers). Source objects are creators of visualization data;
 * filters input, process, and output image data; and mappers
 * transform data into another form (like transforming coordinates or
 * writing data to a file).
 *
 * A major role of ProcessObject is to define the inputs and outputs
 * of a filter. More than one input and/or output may exist for a given
 * filter. Some classes (e.g., source objects or mapper objects) will
 * not use inputs (the source) or outputs (mappers). In this case, the
 * inputs or outputs is just ignored.
 *
 * ProcessObject invokes the following events: 
 * Command::StartEvent, Command::EndEvent
 * These are convenience events you can use for any purpose
 * (e.g., debugging info, highlighting/notifying user interface, etc.) 
 * See Command and LightObject for information on using AddObserver.
 *
 * Another event Command::ProgressEvent can be observed. Some filters invoke
 * this event periodically during their execution (with the progress,
 * parameter, the fraction of work done). The use is similar to that of
 * StartEvent and EndEvent. Filters may also check their
 * AbortGenerateData flag to determine whether to prematurally end their
 * execution.
 *
 * An important feature of subclasses of ProcessObject is that it is
 * possible to control the memory-management model (i.e., retain
 * output versus delete output data). The ReleaseDataFlag enables the
 * deletion of the output data once the downstream process object
 * finishes processing the data (please see text). The
 * ReleaseDataBeforeUpdateFlag enables the deletion of the
 * ProcessObject's output data from a previous update if that output
 * data is slated to be regenerated by the pipeline process.  Setting
 * this flag can control peak memory usage during a subsequent
 * pipeline update.  For a ProcessObject, the ReleaseDataFlag defaults
 * to false and the ReleaseDataBeforeUpdateFlag defaults to true.
 * Some subclasses of ProcessObject, for example ImageSource, use a
 * default setting of false for the ReleaseDataBeforeUpdateFlag.
 *
 * Subclasses of ProcessObject may override 4 of the methods of this class
 * to control how a given filter may interact with the pipeline (dataflow).
 * These methods are: GenerateOutputInformation(),
 * EnlargeOutputRequestedRegion(), GenerateInputRequestedRegion(), and
 * GenerateOutputRequestedRegion(). By overriding these methods, a filter
 * can deviate from the base assumptions of the pipeline execution model.

 * \brief Abstraction of the Events used to communicating among filters
    and with GUIs.
 *
 * EventObject provides a standard coding for sending and receiving messages
 * indicating things like the initiation of processes, end of processes,
 * modification of filters.
 *
 * EventObjects form a hierarchy similar to the itk::ExceptionObject allowing
 * to factorize common events in a tree-like structure. Higher detail can
 * be assigned by users by subclassing existing itk::EventObjects.
 *
 * EventObjects are used by itk::Command and itk::Object for implementing the
 * Observer/Subject design pattern. Observers register their interest in 
 * particular kinds of events produced by a specific itk::Object. This 
 * mechanism decouples classes among them.
 *
 * As opposed to itk::Exception, itk::EventObject does not represent error 
 * states, but simply flow of information allowing to trigger actions 
 * as a consequence of changes occurring in state on some itk::Objects.
 *
 * itk::EventObject carries information in its own type, it relies on the 
 * appropiate use of the RTTI (Run Time Type Information).
 *
 * A set of standard EventObjects is defined near the end of itkEventObject.h.

itkMacro.h defines standard system-wide macros, constants, and other

to interface to instance variables in a standard fashion. For example,
these macros manage modified time, debugging information, and provide a

available for built-in types; for string classe; vector arrays;
object pointers; and debug, warning, and error printout information.
